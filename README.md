## Flutter Preliminary Tasks

### Instructions
- [ ] Fork this repo
- [ ] Install Flutter on your device
- [ ] Create and run a new app (either using an emulator, or in your own device)
- [ ] Upload the contents of the app on your forked Github repository
- [ ] Create a new issue on your forked repo. Copy the contents of this README and paste it there so that you can tick the tasks that you have completed.
- [ ] Start working on the app

### Useful suggestions
- You might want to learn the basics of git first if you don't know it already
- I'll be checking the progress on your forked repo, so keep checking the items in `Instructions`, `Task Description` & `Reading Material` as you complete them.
- <strong> It is not necessary to complete all the tasks. </strong> Complete as many as you can.
- The links to the resources in the `Reading Material` sections are just suggestions. All that matters is that you are familiar with the mentioned topics. Feel free to Google the topics on your own (which I recommend) and, say, read a `Medium` article instead.
- You can contact me, Sunit Gautam, or Anish Saxena if you face any problems.
